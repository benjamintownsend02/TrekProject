# Trek!

This app is a travel tool to learn about a destination city of your choice. Enter a destination city to receive current weather information, a 7 day weather forecast, and a sample of ten local events for that city. If you would like step by step driving directions to that city, simply enter your origin city for the search. The app will even pull images from the destination city and display/cyle through them.
